# Rust Workshop Series

> Note: This book is currently a WIP. Some sections may be missing or
> incomplete.

The following book contains a series chapters designed to be presented to
newcomers to the Rust programming language. Each chapter, otherwise know as
talk, is designed to be approximately an hour long and feature both a speaking
portion as well as a more interactive 'build something' workshop portion. The
ideal time split between the lecture and workshop sections is 50/50.

## Content

The content of the workshop is largely inspired by the official
[book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) with some modifications. Since the Rust
community moves quickly, some content can become stale and could potentially be
older or newer than the book. Best efforts will be made to keep the workshop
content up to date. Furthermore, the workshop is largely geared toward C or
embedded C programmers currently. Since it is based on the book, the content
is general enough for people of various programming backgrounds to understand.
It is important to note, however, most low level or C-like concepts will get
less focus than some of the other elements of the language like ownership,
generics, lifetimes, traits and functional features.

## Source Code
